# NGribCS
This is a fork of GribCS, resuming the development. This is heavy work in progess and should <b>NOT BE USED</b> right now.
It is defunct, and don't blame me, if you do use it anyway...

Update: This project is not dead (dating Feb 2021), but I just have no time (and a puppy) right now
<b>Roadmap:</b><br />
1. A functional version with basic features for grib2 files.<br />
2. Next grib1 will receive the same amount of basic functionality<br />
3. There will be a major code cleanup/overhaul of the old gribcs code<br />
4. New shiny features will be introduced! <br />
