# NGribCS
This is a fork of GribCS, resuming the development. This is heavy work in progess and should <b>NOT BE USED</b> right now.
It is defunct, and don't blame me, if you do use it anyway...

<b>Roadmap:</b><br />
1. A functional version with basic features for grib2 files within in couple of weeks (maybe Aug 2015).<br />
2. Next grib1 will receive the same amount of basic functionality (maybe Sep/Oct 2015).<br />
3. There will be a major code cleanup/overhaul of the old gribcs code, this is going to take the rest of 2015<br />
4. New shiny features will be introduced! <br />
